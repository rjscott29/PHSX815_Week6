# PHSX815_Week6

This week is just an upload of some Monte Carlo Integration. I took much of this from my Week5 project for the calculation of an area, just cleaned it up a little.

Unfortunately, I didn't code this (or test it even) to take input from the command line. You'll have to open it and run it in your favorite coding environment.

You'll see that there are a few definitions. Three, actually. One does a trapezoidal integration, which was taken from Week 5.
One performs a Monte Carlo integration, and the third is a quick attempt at iterating a Monte Carlo integration over a range of datapoints.
This last one spits out a graph of how well the integration performs compared to a hard coded "correct" value, given by a horizontal line at y = value.

I would have loved to have created something a little more user friendly, but I'll get around to that for the next project.

Thanks!
